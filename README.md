# Real-World Hazy Image Dataset Collection
Real world Dataset of hazy images 

## 📌 Overview
This repository describes the data collection process used to acquire real-world hazy images for outdoor scenes. The dataset was created with controlled illumination conditions to ensure consistency and reliability for image processing and computer vision research.

## 📷 Data Collection Methodology
Real-world hazy images were collected from outdoor environments. To reduce illumination variation over time, special measures were taken during image acquisition.

Environmental illumination (measured in **lux**) was monitored using an **Android-based application** developed by *My Mobile Tools Dev*. All images were captured under approximately the same illumination conditions to maintain dataset uniformity.

## ⚙️ Image Acquisition Setup

### 🔹 High-Resolution Image Capture
- **Camera:** NIKON D3300  
- **Mounting:** Tripod stand  
- **Control:** Remote-controlled capture to eliminate manual disturbance  
- **Resolution:** 6000 × 4000  
- **DPI:** 300  
- **Bit Depth:** 24-bit  
- **Orientation:** Horizontal & Vertical  

This setup ensured high-quality image acquisition with minimal motion blur.

### 🔹 Low-Resolution Image Capture
- **Device:** Android smartphone  
- **Mounting:** Tripod stand  
- **Resolution:** 4160 × 1952  
- **DPI:** 72  
- **Bit Depth:** 24-bit  
- **Orientation:** Horizontal & Vertical  

The mobile-based setup enabled efficient acquisition of low-resolution hazy images while maintaining stability and consistent image depth.

## ✨ Key Features
- Controlled illumination during image capture  
- Combination of professional camera and mobile device  
- Tripod-mounted setup for stability  
- High-quality data suitable for research and experimentation  

## 🎯 Applications
This dataset can be used for:
- Image dehazing algorithms  
- Computer vision research  
- Outdoor scene analysis  
- Machine learning and deep learning model training  

## 📄 Notes
- All images were captured under similar environmental illumination conditions.
- The dataset supports both high-resolution and low-resolution image analysis.
