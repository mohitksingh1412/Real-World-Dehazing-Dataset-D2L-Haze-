# Real-World Hazy Image Dataset (D2L-Haze)
Real world Dataset of hazy images 

## 📌 Overview
This repository describes the data collection process used to acquire real-world hazy images for outdoor scenes. The dataset was created with controlled illumination conditions to ensure consistency and reliability for image processing and computer vision research.
We capture 107 high (6000 × 4000,300dpi) and low resolution (4160 × 1952,72dpi) images under the category of dense and low haze respectively (D2L-Haze).

## 📷 Data Collection Methodology
Real-world hazy images were collected from outdoor environments. To reduce illumination variation over time, special measures were taken during image acquisition.

Environmental illumination (measured in **lux**) was monitored using an **Android-based application** developed by *My Mobile Tools Dev*. All images were captured under approximately the same illumination conditions to maintain dataset uniformity.

## ⚙️ Image Acquisition Setup

### 🔹 High-Resolution Image Capture
- **Camera:** NIKON D3300  
- **Mounting:** Tripod stand  
- **Control:** Remote-controlled capture to eliminate manual disturbance  
- **Resolution:** 6000 × 4000  
- **DPI:** 300  
- **Bit Depth:** 24-bit  
- **Orientation:** Horizontal & Vertical  

This setup ensured high-quality image acquisition with minimal motion blur.

### 🔹 Low-Resolution Image Capture
- **Device:** Android smartphone  
- **Mounting:** Tripod stand  
- **Resolution:** 4160 × 1952  
- **DPI:** 72  
- **Bit Depth:** 24-bit  
- **Orientation:** Horizontal & Vertical  

The mobile-based setup enabled efficient acquisition of low-resolution hazy images while maintaining stability and consistent image depth.

## ✨ Key Features
- Controlled illumination during image capture  
- Combination of professional camera and mobile device  
- Tripod-mounted setup for stability  
- High-quality data suitable for research and experimentation  

## 🎯 Applications
This dataset can be used for:
